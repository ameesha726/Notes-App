#  Notes App (Next.js + FastAPI + MongoDB)

##  Project Description
The **Notes App** is a full-stack web application that allows users to **create, view, edit, and delete notes** securely.  
It is built with **Next.js** on the frontend and **FastAPI** on the backend, using **MongoDB** as the database.  
The application implements **JWT-based authentication**, so each user can access and manage only their own notes.

The frontend uses a **hand-crafted UI with Tailwind CSS** and lightweight state management with **Zustand**, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.  
The backend is designed for **performance and scalability**, using asynchronous operations with Motor (MongoDB driver) and optimized API endpoints.
